# This is the biggest worldwide name dataset

I've concatenated japanese name dataset from Green Adam(http://green.adam.ne.jp/roomazi/namae.html) and ENAMDICT (http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/enamdict_doc.html) and also added names from public Brazilian names datasets provided at (https://github.com/datasets-br/prenomes), also added information from Philip Peremy dataset (https://github.com/philipperemy/name-dataset).
